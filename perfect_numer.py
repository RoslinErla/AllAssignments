#Write a Python program using for loops that, given an integer n, prints all the perfect numbers from 1 to n. 
# A perfect number is an integer whose sum of integer divisiors (excluding the number itself) add up to the number.
# For example, 6 is a perfect number because the sum of its integer divisors (1+2+3) is equal to 6.
top_num = int(input("Upper number for the range: ")) # Do not change this line
