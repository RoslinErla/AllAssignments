# In this assignment you will help a new bank get up and running. 
# This bank has two kinds of accounts, a savings account and a debit account. 
# You will need to use inheritance in this assignment 
# so you will need to figure out what the account types have in common 
# and what they donÂ´t. 
# The accounts should have a method called update_balance() which updates the balance.

# A savings account updates the balance as follows:

# It updates the balance by its yearly interest rate and adds a bonus rate to it.
#  For a savings account the interest rate is 5% and the bonus rate is 10%.

# A debet account updates the balance as follows:
# It updates the balance by its yearly interest rate which is 2 %.
# HINT: think about using class variables for the constants (interest rate and bonus rate).

# You also need to implement the __str__() method. 
# Think about where you should implement it. 
# You only need to implement it once. 
# Look at the output example here below to figure out what string the method should return.

# You also need to implement the functions print_accounts() 
# which should print each account and update_accounts() which should update each account.
