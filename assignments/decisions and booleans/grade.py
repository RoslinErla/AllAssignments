# Write a program that prompts for a grade (a float). 
#  A valid grade is between 0.0 and 10.0 (both inclusive).  
# A passing grade is between 5.0 and 10.0 (both inclusive).  
# The program pints out "Invalid grade!", "Passing grade!", or "Failing grade!", depending on the input.

grade = float(input("Input a grade: ")) # Do not change this line

# Fill in the missing code below
if grade < 0 or grade >10.0:
    print("Invalid grade!") # Do not change this line
elif grade >= 5.0 and grade <= 10.0:
    print("Passing grade!") # Do not change this line
else:
    print("Failing grade!") # Do not change this line
